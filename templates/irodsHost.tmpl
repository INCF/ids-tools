# This is the optional host configuration file for configuring the
# equivalent host address used by the iRODS server. The server uses
# the gethostbyname() call to get the network address of each host but
# this call may not be able to get all the special network addresses
# configured for this host. In this case, a line should be added in
# this file for each host that requires clarification. Each line
# should list all the hostnames and addresses (separated by spaces)
# for a given host. If the host is the local host, the first entry
# must be the keyword "localhost" followed by all the local host
# addresses. In addition, the first entry following the "localhost"
# is the preferred address and will be used for connecting to clients 
# and remote servers. 
# Similarly, a line can be entered for each remote host. This line will 
# not begin with the "localhost" keyword and the first entry is the
# preferred address.  
# e.g. :
# localhost one.ucsd.edu one
localhost %(irods_host)s %(irods_short_hostname)s
